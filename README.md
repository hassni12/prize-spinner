# Three Percent Discount Wheel Example
 Basic rotateable discount wheel that always stops on 3 percent discount

# AlwaysOnThreePercentDiscount
This is an example of a rotate-able discount / prize wheel to use on web. Its made based on HTML5 and PhaserJS.

The wheel will always stops at 3% discount. You can tweak to make it stops on another spot. This one is simple because rotation is fake, determined, not real or random rotation.

# RandomRouletteWheel
This is the second version of the roulette wheel that can spin randomly and stop on few random numbers, made with JavaScript and PhaserJS.

That old version only stops on 3% discounts. This one can stop on one of many random numbers.
